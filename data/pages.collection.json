Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autistichoya.com\/p\/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html\">this guide.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sexism<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Using gendered terms like \"dude\" or \"guys\" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals.
